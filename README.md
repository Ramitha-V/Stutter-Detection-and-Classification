# Stutter Detection and Classification

Stuttering is a neuro-developmental speech disorder that interrupts the flow of speech due to involuntary pauses and sound repetitions. It has profound psychological impacts that affect social interactions and professional advancements. 

Automatically detecting stuttering events in speech recordings could assist speech therapists or speech pathologists track the fluency of people who stutter (PWS). It will also assist in the improvement of the existing speech recognition system for PWS. 

In this project, the SEP-28k dataset is utilized to perform comparative analysis to assess the performance of various machine learning models in classifying the five dysfluency types namely Prolongation, Interjection, Word Repetition, Sound Repetition and Blocks.
